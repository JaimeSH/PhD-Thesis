This Chapter describes a series of experiments that were performed in order to
demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed method regarding two areas:
forecasting and interpretability. The forecasting capabilities of the method are
demonstrated by exhibiting how the multi-agent model simulates the prices in
training and testing datasets, and how the system's curve-fitting error
decreased throughout the genetic algorithm's generations. The simulated profits
are also included, for both the training and testing datasets. Regarding the
interpretation capabilities of the method, a description of how the agents
perceive the market is shown. This description also describes what actions the
agents take according to their perceptions.

A total of 135 experiments were performed, but due to space constraints in this
thesis document, only some of the experiments are shown. The reader can find the
plots and interpretations for all the experiments performed in the Git
repository of this thesis here: https://github.com/amherag/PhD-Thesis/.

% All 100 gen, same range of time
% We sort by number of agents and then by profit in insights
