abstract = {Three main streams of evolutionary algorithms (EAs), probabilistic optimization algorithms based on the model of natural evolution, are compared in this article: evolution strategies (ESs), evolutionary programming (EP), and genetic algorithms (GAs). The comparison is performed with respect to certain characteristic components of EAs: the representation scheme of object variables, mutation, recombination, and the selection operator. Furthermore, each algorithm is formulated in a high-level notation as an instance of the general, unifying basic algorithm, and the fundamental theoretical results on the algorithms are presented. Finally, after presenting experimental results for three test functions representing a unimodal and a multimodal case as well as a step function with discontinuities, similarities and differences of the algorithms are elaborated, and some hints to open research questions are sketched.},

abstract = {This paper derives and implements a framework in which to test whether conditional asset pricing models, applied to single securities, can explain the size, value, turnover, and momentum effects in expected stock returns. In this framework individual stock betas vary with firm level size and book-to-market as well as with macroeconomic variables. The evidence shows that under the extensively studied constant beta framework, none of the models examined capture any of the size, value, turnover, and past return effects, even when returns are risk-adjusted by size, value, liquidity, and momentum factors. In contrast, when beta is allowed to vary, the size and book to market effects are often explained, but the explanatory power of turnover and past return remains robust. The past return or momentum effect is related to model mispricing that varies with macroeconomic variables, whereas turnover shows no business cycle patterns. },

In this paper, we define the concepts of intuitionistic preference relation, consistent intuitionistic preference relation, incomplete intuitionistic preference relation and acceptable intuitionistic preference relation, and study their various properties. We develop an approach to group decision making based on intuitionistic preference relations and an approach to group decision making based on incomplete intuitionistic preference relations respectively, in which the intuitionistic fuzzy arithmetic averaging operator and intuitionistic fuzzy weighted arithmetic averaging operator are used to aggregate intuitionistic preference information, and the score function and accuracy function are applied to the ranking and selection of alternatives. Finally, a practical example is provided to illustrate the developed approaches. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Financial market prediction and trading presents a challenging task that attracts great interest from researchers and investors because success may result in substantial rewards. This paper describes the application of a hierarchical coevolutionary fuzzy system called HiCEFS for predicting financial time series. A novel financial trading system using HiCEFS as a predictive model and employing a prudent trading strategy based on the price percentage oscillator (PPO) is proposed. In order to construct an accurate predictive model, a form of generic membership function named irregular shaped membership function (ISMF) is employed and a hierarchical coevolutionary genetic algorithm (HCGA) is adopted to automatically derive the ISMFs for each input feature in HiCEFS. With the accurate prediction from HiCEFS and the prudent trading strategy, the proposed system outperforms the simple buy-and-hold strategy, the trading system without prediction and the trading system with other predictive models (EFuNN, DENFIS and RSPOP) on real-world financial data.},

In this ground-breaking book, John Koza shows how this remarkable paradigm works and provides substantial empirical evidence that solutions to a great variety of problems from many different fields can be found by genetically breeding populations of computer programs. Genetic Programming contains a great many worked examples and includes a sample computer code that will allow readers to run their own programs.In getting computers to solve problems without being explicitly programmed, Koza stresses two points: that seemingly different problems from a variety of fields can be reformulated as problems of program induction, and that the recently developed genetic programming paradigm provides a way to search the space of possible computer programs for a highly fit individual computer program to solve the problems of program induction. Good programs are found by evolving them in a computer against a fitness measure instead of by sitting down and writing them.John R.

Previous work using genetic algorithms has focused on the development of rule sets or high performance membership functions; however, the interdependence between these two components suggests a simultaneous design procedure would be a more appropriate methodology. When GA's have been used to develop both, it has been done serially, e.g., design the membership functions and then use them in the design of the rule set. This, however, means that the membership functions were optimized for the initial rule set and not the rule set designed subsequently. GA's are fully capable of creating complete fuzzy controllers given the equations of motion of the system, eliminating the need for human input in the design loop. This new method has been applied to two problems, a cart controller and a truck controller. Beyond the development of these controllers, we also examine the design of a robust controller for the cart problem and its ability to overcome faulty rules},

The shift from a 'locally originate and locally-hold' model of mortgage provision to a securitised 'locally originate and globally distribute' model meant that when local subprime mortgage markets collapsed in the USA, the repercussions were felt globally. At the same time, the global credit crunch and the deep recession the global financial crisis precipitated have had locally varying impacts and consequences.

In this paper, first, the definition of the degree of similarity between IFSs is introduced. Then, several new similarity measures between IFSs are proposed and corresponding proofs are given. Finally, the similarity measures of IFSs are applied to pattern recognitions. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {With the demand for knowledge-handling systems capable of dealing with and distinguishing between various facets of imprecision ever increasing, a clear and formal characterization of the mathematical models implementing such services is quintessential. In this paper, this task is undertaken simultaneously for the definition of implication within two settings: first, within intuitionistic fuzzy set theory and secondly, within interval-valued fuzzy set theory. By tracing these models back to the underlying lattice that they are defined on, on one hand we keep up with an important tradition of using algebraic structures for developing logical calculi (e.g. residuated lattices and MV algebras), and on the other hand we are able to expose in a clear manner the two models' formal equivalence. This equivalence, all too often neglected in literature, we exploit to construct operators extending the notions of classical and fuzzy implication on these structures; to initiate a meaningful classification framework for the resulting operators, based on logical and extra-logical criteria imposed on them; and finally, to re(de)fine the intuititive ideas giving rise to both approaches as models of imprecision and apply them in a practical context. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

There are more than 100 indicators used in practice today to understand the market behavior. Identification of the right combination of indicators for optimal portfolio performance has always been a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning approach to generate trading signals (buy / sell) using a combination of technical indicators. Proposed system uses a genetic algorithm along with principle component analysis to identify a subset of technical indicators which detect rise and fall of the market with greater accuracy and generates realistic trading signals. The performance of this new algorithm was tested using trading data obtained from National Stock Exchange (NSE), India. Simulation shows the enhanced profitability for the proposed trading strategy},

@article{Lu2009,
abstract = {As financial time series are inherently noisy and non-stationary, it is regarded as one of the most challenging applications of time series forecasting. Due to the advantages of generalization capability in obtaining a unique solution, support vector regression (SVR) has also been successfully applied in financial time series forecasting. In the modeling of financial time series using SVR, one of the key problems is the inherent high noise. Thus, detecting and removing the noise are important but difficult tasks when building an SVR forecasting model. To alleviate the influence of noise, a two-stage modeling approach using independent component analysis (ICA) and support vector regression is proposed in financial time series forecasting. ICA is a novel statistical signal processing technique that was originally proposed to find the latent source signals from observed mixture signals without having any prior knowledge of the mixing mechanism. The proposed approach first uses ICA to the forecasting variables for generating the independent components (ICs). After identifying and removing the ICs containing the noise, the rest of the ICs are then used to reconstruct the forecasting variables which contain less noise and served as the input variables of the SVR forecasting model. In order to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach, the Nikkei 225 opening index and TAIEX closing index are used as illustrative examples. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the SVR model with non-filtered forecasting variables and a random walk model.},

abstract = {The Wave Principle, known as Elliott Wave Principle (EWP), is a theory widely used in technical analysis and is based on the idea that the fluctuations in markets follow recognizable and repetitive cycles, which are the reflection of market participants' mass psychology. Considering that metal commodity prices have empirically demonstrated cyclical behavior and investors and speculators' mass physiology could be becoming an influential factor in commodities price formation given their increasing participation in last decades, this article explores whether EWP can be used to analyze commodity cycles. To see the applicability of EWP to commodity markets, a Monte-Carlo simulation was conducted over detected Elliott waves in the prices of gold, silver and copper, as well as on a metal price index. The results of the investigation suggest that EWP would not be a strong approach to analyze commodity markets in a cycle basis, which is confirmed by the results of the simulation. Nevertheless, there is evidence that mass psychology affects commodity markets as posited by Elliott, and therefore this factor could be considered as an explanatory variable of commodity price formation and cycles, for what is proposed to test its causality.},

In our proposed approach, we have employed a combination of two applications for analysis, namely Network Workbench and CiteSpace-wherein Network Workbench allowed for the analysis of complex network aspects of the domain, detailed visualization-based analysis of the bibliographic data was performed using CiteSpace. Our results include the identification of the largest cluster based on keywords, the timeline of publication of index terms, the core journals and key subject categories. We also identify the core authors, top countries of origin of the manuscripts along with core research institutes. Finally, our results have interestingly revealed the strong presence of agent-based computing in a number of non-computing related scientific domains including Life Sciences, Ecological Sciences and Social Sciences.},

We show that less than 50{\%} of the 120 strategies implemented in the article yield statistically significant profits and, unconditionally, momentum and contrarian strategies are equally likely to be successful. However, when we condition on the return horizon (short, medium, or long) of the strategy, or the time period during which it is implemented, two patterns emerge. A momentum strategy is usually profitable at the medium (3- to 12-months) horizon, while a contrarian strategy nets statistically significant profits at long horizons, but only during the 1926-1947 subperiod. More importantly, our results show that the cross-sectional variation in the mean returns of individual securities included in these strategies play an important role in their profitability. The cross-sectional variation can potentially account for the profitability of momentum strategies and it is also responsible for attenuating the profits from price reversals to long-horizon contrarian strategies.},

@article{Jennings2001,
abstract = {This article explores why agent oriented approaches are well suited for developing complex distributed systems, like in a range of telecommunication, commercial, and industrial applications. If agents have to enter the mainstream of software engineering it is vital that clear arguments are advanced as to their suitability for solving large classes of problems. It is shown how agent oriented approaches apply in a specific telecommunication application. In making these arguments, it is possible for proponents of other software engineering paradigms to claim that the key concepts of agent-oriented computing can be reproduced using their technique. Agent-oriented systems are, after all, computer programs and all programs have the same set of computable functions. However, this misses the point. The value of a paradigm is the mindset and techniques it provides to software engineers. In this respect, agent-oriented concepts and techniques are both well suited to developing complex, distributed systems and an extension of those currently available in other paradigms.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. The software presented in this paper is an implementation of an intuitionistic fuzzy inference system. Such type of fuzzy inference systems provide an extra layer of uncertainty, called indeterminacy, that the user can integrate in the antecedents and consequents of the fuzzy system. The additional calculations required to make an inference in this type of system needs a negligible extra amount of computational resources, making it a low-cost alternative to type-2 fuzzy inference systems. At the current time, no other implementation of such type of system exist that is open source and free of charge. The software is developed in Clojure in order to leverage the Java libraries, the JVM itself, and the capabilities of the programming language to implement concurrency in a convenient manner. However, the goal of this implementation is to provide a language-agnostic interface based in a REST API, which can be used by any programming language capable of handling HTTP requests. A comparison between a traditional type-1 fuzzy inference is provided, where the reader can observe how the indeterminacy affects the outputs of the system.},

abstract = {Stock markets are very important in modern societies and their behavior has serious implications for a wide spectrum of the world's population. Investors, governing bodies, and society as a whole could benefit from better understanding of the behavior of stock markets. The traditional approach to analyzing such systems is the use of analytical models. However, the complexity of financial markets represents a big challenge to the analytical approach. Most analytical models make simplifying assumptions, such as perfect rationality and homogeneous investors, which threaten the validity of their results. This motivates alternative methods.In this paper, we report an artificial financial market and its use in studying the behavior of stock markets. This is an endogenous market, with which we model technical, fundamental, and noise traders. Nevertheless, our primary focus is on the technical traders, which are sophisticated genetic programming based agents that co- evolve (by learning based on their fitness function) by predicting investment opportunities in the market using technical analysis as the main tool. With this endogenous artificial market, we identify the conditions under which the statistical properties of price series in the artificial market resemble some of the properties of real financial markets. By performing a careful exploration of the most important aspects of our simulation model, we determine the way in which the factors of such a model affect the endogenously generated price. Additionally, we model the pressure to beat the market by a behavioral constraint imposed on the agents reflecting the Red Queen principle in evolution. We have demonstrated how evolutionary computation could play a key role in studying stock markets, mainly as a suitable model for economic learning on an agent- based simulation.},

In order to distinguish the effects of market architectures alone, we use a controlled environment where allocative and informational issues are neglected and agents do not optimize or learn. Hence, we rule out the possibility that the behavior of traders drives the price dynamics. Aiming to compare price stability and execution quality in broad sense, we analyze standard deviation, excess kurtosis, tail exponent of returns, volume, perceived gain by traders and bid-ask spread. Overall, a dealership market appears to be the best candidate, generating low volume and volatility, virtually no excess kurtosis and high perceived gain.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new architecture to study artificial stock markets. This architecture rests on a mechanism called 'school' which is a procedure to map the phenotype to the genotype or, in plain English, to uncover the secret of success. We propose an agent-based model of 'school', and consider school as an evolving population driven by single-population GP (SGP). The architecture also takes into consideration traders' search behavior. By simulated annealing, traders' search density can be connected to psychological factors, such as peer pressure or economic factors such as the standard of living. This market architecture was then implemented in a standard artificial stock market. Our econometric study of the resultant artificial time series evidences that the return series is independently and identically distributed (iid), and hence supports the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). What is interesting though is that this iid series was generated by traders, who do not believe in the EMH at all. In fact, our study indicates that many of our traders were able to find useful signals quite often from business school, even though these signals were short-lived. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {Prediction markets are an interesting instrument to draw on the "wisdom of the crowds", e.g., to forecast sales or project risks. So far, mainly two market mechanisms have been implemented in prediction markets, the continuous double auction and logarithmic market scoring rule. However, the effects of the choice between these two market mechanisms on relevant variables such as prediction market accuracy are not fully understood. These effects are relevant as faulty prediction market outcomes might cause wrong decisions. This work contributes via an experiment-based simulation model to understand the mechanism-related effects and to direct further laboratory experiments. Our results show, that the mechanism decision does matter. Due to the higher amount of trades and the lower standard deviation of the price, the logarithmic market scoring rule seems to have a clear advantage on a first view. Taking the accuracy error as an independent variable, the effects are not as straightforward and depend on the environment and actors. {\textcopyright} ECMS Klaus G.

abstract = {Technica, or chartist, analysis of financial markets involves providing forecasts or trading advice on the basis of largely visual inspection of past prices, without regard to any underlying economic or 'fundamental' analysis. This paper reports the results of a questionnaire survey, conducted on behalf of the Bank of England, among chief foreign exchange dealers based in London in November 1988. Amongst other findings, it is revealed that at least 90 per cent of respondents place some weight on this form of non-fundamental analysis when forming views at one or more time horizons. There is also a skew towards reliance on technical, as opposed to fundamentalist, analysis at shorter horizons, which becomes steadily reversed as the length of horizon considered is increased. A very high proportion of chief dealers view technical and fundamental analysis as complementary forms of analysis and a substantial proportion suggest that technical advice may be self-fulfilling.

FTSGA improves the performance by applying the operations of genetic algorithm such as selection, crossover and mutation to iteratively search a good discourse partition. TAIEX is selected as the experimental data set.

abstract = {Individuals influence each others' decisions about cultural products such as songs, books, and movies; but to what extent can the perception of success become a "self-fulfilling prophecy"? We have explored this question experimentally by artificially inverting the true popularity of songs in an online "music market," in which 12,207 participants listened to and downloaded songs by unknown bands. We found that most songs experienced self-fulfilling prophecies, in which perceived - but initially false - popularity became real over time. We also found, however, that the inversion was not self-fulfilling for the market as a whole, in part because the very best songs recovered their popularity in the long run. Moreover, the distortion of market information reduced the correlation between appeal and popularity, and led to fewer overall downloads. These results, although partial and speculative, suggest a new approach to the study of cultural markets, and indicate the potential of web-based experiments to explore the social psychological origin of other macro-sociological phenomena},

abstract = {Multiagent systems consist of multiple autonomous entities having different information and/or diverging interests. This comprehensive introduction to the field offers a computer science perspective, but also draws on ideas from game theory, economics, operations research, logic, philosophy and linguistics. It will serve as a reference for researchers in each of these fields, and be used as a text for advanced undergraduate and graduate courses. Emphasizing foundations, the authors offer a broad and rigorous treatment of their subject, with thorough presentations of distributed problem solving, non-cooperative game theory, multiagent communication and learning, social choice, mechanism design, auctions, coalitional game theory, and logical theories of knowledge, belief, and other aspects of rational agency. For each topic, basic concepts are introduced, examples are given, proofs of key results are offered, and algorithmic considerations are examined. An appendix covers background material in probability theory, classical logic, Markov decision processes, and mathematical programming.},

@article{Shoham1993,
abstract = {A new computational framework is presented, called agent-oriented programming (AOP), which can be viewed as a specialization of object-oriented programming. The state of an agent consists of components such as beliefs, decisions, capabilities, and obligations; for this reason the state of an agent is called its mental state. The mental state of agents is described formally in an extension of standard epistemic logics: beside temporalizing the knowledge and belief operators, AOP introduces operators for obligation, decision, and capability. Agents are controlled by agent programs, which include primitives for communicating with other agents. In the spirit of speech act theory, each communication primitive is of a certain type: informing, requesting, offering, and so on. This article presents the concept of AOP, discusses the concept of mental state and its formal underpinning, defines a class of agent interpreters, and then describes in detail a specific interpreter that has been implemented. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

@article{Arthur1999,
abstract = {After two centuries of studying equilibria - static patterns that call for no further behavioral adjustments - economists are beginning to study the general emergence of structures and the unfolding of patterns in the economy. When viewed in out-of-equilibrium formation, economic patterns sometimes simplify into the simple static equilibria of standard economics. More often they are ever changing, showing perpetually novel behavior and emergent phenomena. Complexity portrays the economy not as deterministic, predictable, and mechanistic, but as process dependent, organic, and always evolving.},
