%% curve-fitting
In several efforts, researchers create regression models using technical or
fundamental indicators as training datasets. Examples of regression techniques
are autoregression \cite{burg1968new}, symbolic regression
\cite{billard2002symbolic}, and linear regression \cite{kutner2004applied}.


%% preprocessing
The work by Lu, Lee, and Chiu \cite{Lu2009} point out the complexity of
financial time-series. They note its noisy nature and propose a technique to
reduce this noise based in a two-stage modeling approach using Independent
Component Analysis (ICA) and Support Vector Regression (SVR). Their approach
first uses ICA for generating independent components to identify and remove
those containing the noise, then the remaining components are used to
reconstruct the forecasting variables which now contain less noise and are the
input of the SVR forecasting model.


%% neural networks
Lastly, it is imperative to mention the use of Neural Networks in regression
tasks, as it is a technique that has been proved to be very effective for this
kind of problems. O'Connor and Madden \cite{Connor2005} obtained some remarkable
results where they obtained an annual 23.5\% of Rate of Investment on Dow Jones
data used for training and testing. Another example is given by Castillo and
Melin \cite{castillo2001simulation}, where they compare different hybrid
architectures that combine Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic for the prediction of
financial time-series.

\section{Multi-agent Systems}
\label{section:multi-agent-systems}

The core algorithm of the proposed method is, at its highest level, a
multi-agent system.

Kendall and Su \cite{Kendall2003} use a multi-agent system to simulate stock
markets within which stock traders are modeled as heterogeneous adaptive
artificial agents. On average, 80\% of the artificial stock traders were able to
trade using successful trading strategies which brings the investors higher
returns compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy.

The authors of this work gained useful knowledge about multi-agent system from
two theses. The first one is the work from Grothmann \cite{Grothmann2002},
``Multi-agent Market Modeling based on Neural Networks.'' This work served as
inspiration for the architecture of the Proposed Method. The second thesis is
Boer-Sorb{\'{a}}n's ``Agent-Based Simulation of Financial Markets,'' which gave
an overview of approaches to describe and understand financial market's
dynamics, and motivated the authors of this work to use the approach of
Agent-based Computation to perform financial forecast.

As a final mention, Samanidou, et. al. \cite{Samanidou_2007}, provides the
reader a very comprehensive overview of Agent-based Modeling, where different
techniques to perform this kind of models are discussed.

\section{Optimization Algorithms}
\label{section:optimization-algorithms}

Thrift \cite{Thrift1991} explores a nowadays widely used technique which
involves the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to discover the parameters of the
Membership Functions (MF) in a Fuzzy Inference System to obtain a better
performance. Homaifar and McCormick \cite{Homaifar1995} go further and use GA to
simultaneously design the MF and the rule sets for fuzzy logic controllers.

\section{Type-2 Fuzzy Systems}
\label{section:type-2-fuzzy-systems}

\section{Intuitionistic Fuzzy Systems}
\label{section:related-work-intuitionistic-fuzzy-systems}

Wagner presents a robust implementation of FISs developed in Java in
\cite{Wagner2013}. The authors of the present work have used this particular
toolkit for comparisons in the capabilities of the IFIS to model uncertainty
against type-1 FISs and interval type-2 FISs in
\cite{Hernandez-Aguila2016}. Although the toolkit does not provide many tools
for representing a FIS graphically or for interacting with one, the
implementation provides libraries for building type-1, interval type-2, and
generalized type-2 fuzzy systems.

The work by Castro et al. \cite{castro2007interval} provides similar
capabilities as the work by Wagner, but in this case it is an implementation in
Matlab. A direct disadvantage of using this programming language is that Matlab
is not a free nor open source software.  Nevertheless, the language is still
widely used in the scientific community. Furthermore, this implementation
follows an interface similar to the one provided by Matlab's fuzzy logic
toolbox, and provides more robust graphical implementations than the current
version of Wagner's toolkit.

\subsection{Membership and Non-Membership Functions Design}
\label{subsection:related-work-membership-and-non-membership-functions-design}

The most common approach to graphically representing an IFS is by
lattices. Examples of this type of representation can be found in the works by
I. Despi et al. \cite{Despi2013}, and G. Deschrijver et
al. \cite{Deschrijver2004}. This is a popular approach to graphically represent
an IFS as it enables more compact and concise mathematical expressions. Another
representation that is suitable for mathematical processes is that of a matrix,
and is discussed in detail in the works by R. Parvathi et
al. \cite{Parvathi2014}, G. Çuvalcioglu et al. \cite{Yilmaz2015}, and S. Yilmaz
et al. \cite{Yilmaz2015a}.

IFSs that are graphically represented like membership functions are usually
represented in Mamdani FISs, and some example works are the ones by
K. T. Atanassov \cite{Atanassov1986}, and H. Davarzani and M. A. Khorheh
\cite{Davarzani2013}. This notation can be suitable for representing an
architecture of an IFIS, but if the plot is in black and white, or in greyscale,
the reader can get confused by the membership and non-membership plots. This
problem can be alleviated by plotting the membership and non-membership
functions in separate plots, as in the works by O. Castillo et
al. \cite{castillo2007intuitionistic}, and M. Akram et al. \cite{Akram2014}.

There are several other graphical representations of IFSs, such as by radar
charts, as in the work by V. Atanassova \cite{Atanassova2010}, and by
geometrical representations, orthogonal projections and three-dimensional
representations, as can be found in the work by E Szmidt and J. Kacprzyk
\cite{Szmidt2000}.

Some applications of IFSs in the area of medical sciences can be found in the
works by E. Szmidt and J. Kacprzyk \cite{Szmidt2001}, C. M. Own \cite{Own2009},
and D. D. Chakarska and L. S. Antonov \cite{Antonov1995}. In the area of group
decision making, we have an example in the work by Z. Xu \cite{Xu2007}. IFSs
have also been used in word recognition, in the area of artificial vision, as in
the example work of L. Baccour et al. \cite{Baccour2008}.

This work proposes that IFSs, in a Mamdani IFIS, should follow an approach
similar to that found in the work by K. T. Atanassov \cite{Atanassov2003}, where
the membership is plotted as is commonly done in a traditional FIS, but the
non-membership function should be plotted as 1-υA. The reason behind this
decision is that the non-membership function should be easily differentiated
from the membership function, while seeing both functions in the same plot. An
implementation of an IFIS that uses this approach for representing IFSs for a
Mamdani IFIS can be found in the work by A. Hernandez-Aguila and
M. Garcia-Valdez \cite{Hernandez-aguila}.

In Figure \ref{figure:traditional-set-as-ifs}, one can see how a traditional
fuzzy set can be constructed using the proposed approach. A Gaussian membership
function with mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 15 is depicted.

\begin{figure}
\caption{A traditional fuzzy set represented as an intuitionistic fuzzy set}
\centering \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{img/traditional-set-as-ifs.png}
\label{figure:traditional-set-as-ifs}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{figure:example-of-ifs} is the first case of an IFS that cannot be
considered a tradi-tional fuzzy set. The red line represents the membership
function, while the blue line represents the non-membership function. As can be
seen, the Gaussian membership function does not have a kernel, meaning that its
highest valued member does not equal to 1. In this case, its highest valued
member equals to 0.7, and for the non-membership function, its highest valued
member equals to 0.3. The Gaussian membership function is constructed with a
mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 15. For the non-membership function, it
is con-structed with a mean of 30 and standard deviation of 30.
