\subsection{Financial Forecasting}
\label{financial-forecasting}

In general, this work involves the use of Machine Learning to forecast
financial markets. In several efforts, researchers create regression
models using Technical or Fundamental Indicators as trainig
datasets. Examples of regression techniques are autoregression
\cite{burg1968new}, symbolic regression \cite{billard2002symbolic},
and linear regression \cite{kutner2004applied}.

The work by Brown, Pelosi and Dirska \cite{brown2013dynamic} uses a
Niche Genetic Algorithm called Dynamic-radius Species-conserving
Genetic Algorithm (DSGA) to select stocks to purchase from the Dow
Jones Index. It is important to mention this work because, in the end,
the DSS that is presented in the Proposed Method does the same kind of
recommendation as in their work. More importantly, Brown, et al.,
uploaded the dataset that the authors of the present work used to
perform the different experiments. In Section
\ref{experiments-and-results} a comparison to their work is provided,
along with many other experiments.

The work by Lu, Lee, and Chiu \cite{Lu2009} point out the complexity
of financial time-series. They note its noisy nature and propose a
technique to reduce this noise based in a two-stage modeling approach
using Independent Component Analysis (ICA) and Support Vector
Regression (SVR). Their approach first uses ICA for generating
independent components to identify and remove those containing the
noise, then the remaining components are used to reconstruct the
forecasting variables which now contain less noise and are the input
of the SVR forecasting model. Their work was important for the
development of the Proposed Method, as we believe that the ABM
approach can then be used to diminish the noise in the market, by
using a separate class of agents dedicated to model it.

Lastly, it is imperative to mention the use of Neural Networks in
regression tasks, as it is a technique that has been proved to be very
effective for this kind of problems. O'Connor and Madden
\cite{Connor2005} obtained some remarkable results where they obtained
an annual 23.5\% of Rate of Investment on Dow Jones data used for
training and testing. Another example is given by Castillo and Melin
\cite{castillo2001simulation}, where they compare different hybrid
architectures that combine Neural Networks and Fuzzy Logic for the
prediction of financial time-series.

\subsection{Multi-agent Systems}
\label{multi-agent-systems}

The core algorithm of the Proposed Method is, at its highest level, a Multi-agent System. It is therefore paramount to mention some works which use MAS for the forecast or understanding of financial markets.

Klingert and Meyer \cite{Klingert_2012} implement a MAS to analyze the effect of two market mechanisms: the continuous double auction and logarithmic market scoring rule. The purpose of the agent-based simulation model is to see the effect on the number of trades, the accuracy of prediction markets and the standard deviation of the prices in order to prove three hypothesis that they propose. In the end, due to a higher amount of trades and lower standard deviation of the price, their results indicate that the logarithmic market scoring rule seems to have an advantage over the other mechanism.

Sherstov and Stone \cite{Sherstov2005} present three automated stock-trading agents which follow different strategies to predict financial markets, and are compared. The first agent uses Reinforcement Learning, the second a Trend-following strategy, and the last one Market-making. These agents are part of a MAS where the better performing agent is chosen for the testing phase. It is noteworthy to mention that their strategy was used in a live competition and won.

Kendall and Su \cite{Kendall2003} use a MAS to simulate stock markets within which stock traders are modeled as heterogeneous adaptive artificial agents. On average, 80\% of the artificial stock traders were able to trade using successful trading strategies which brings the investors higher returns compared to a simple buy-and-hold strategy.

The authors of this work gained useful knowledge about MAS from two theses. The first one is the work from Grothmann \cite{Grothmann2002}, ``Multi-agent Market Modeling based on Neural Networks.'' This work served as inspiration for the architecture of the Proposed Method. The second thesis is Boer-Sorb{\'{a}}n's ``Agent-Based Simulation of Financial Markets,'' which gave an overview of approaches to describe and understand financial market's dynamics, and motivated the authors of this work to use the approach of Agent-based Computation to perform financial forecast.

As a final mention, Samanidou, et. al. \cite{Samanidou_2007}, provides the reader a very comprehensive overview of Agent-based Modeling, where different techniques to perform this kind of models are discussed.

\subsection{Genetic Algorithms}
\label{genetic-algorithms}

In the Proposed Method, Genetic Programming is used to generate the Membership Functions (MF) of the Fuzzy Inference Systems that act as the agents' functions. The use of Evolutionary Algorithms to generate MF has been proposed before in several works. What follows is the mention of two works which use Genetic Algorithms to perform such a task, and in the next Subsection, one can find more specialized works where Genetic Programming is used.

Thrift \cite{Thrift1991} explores a nowadays widely used technique which involves the use of a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to discover the parameters of the Membership Functions (MF) in a Fuzzy Inference System to obtain a better performance. Homaifar and McCormick \cite{Homaifar1995} go further and use GA to simultaneously design the MF and the rule sets for fuzzy logic controllers.

\subsection{Intuitionistic Fuzzy Systems}
\label{subsection:related-work-intuitionistic-fuzzy-systems}

There are some noteworthy toolkits for the creation of FISs, and this Section gives a brief description of the ones that have had
the strongest influence to the present work.

Wagner presents a robust implementation of FISs developed in Java in \cite{Wagner2013}. The authors of the present work
have used this particular toolkit for comparisons in the capabilities of the IFIS to model uncertainty against type-1 FISs and interval
type-2 FISs in \cite{Hernandez-Aguila2016}. Although the toolkit does not provide many tools for representing a FIS graphically or for
interacting with one, the implementation provides libraries for building type-1, interval type-2, and generalized type-2 fuzzy systems.

Moreover, the work by Castro et al. \cite{castro2007interval} provides the same capabilities as the work by Wagner, but in this case 
it is an implementation in Matlab. A direct disadvantage of using this programming language is that Matlab is not
a free nor open source software.
Nevertheless, the language is still widely used in the scientific community. Furthermore, this implementation follows an interface 
similar to the one provided by Matlab's fuzzy logic toolbox, and provides more robust graphical implementations than the 
current version of Wagner's toolkit.

The present work aims to provide an easily extensible implementation of an IFS with several tools to analyze 
its developed fuzzy logic systems.
