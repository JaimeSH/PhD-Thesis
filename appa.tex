%% The sets of interpretations for this model are seen to differ in their
%% profits. However, as can be read in the interpretations, most of the agents in
%% the testing stage suggest that no trade should be made in those market
%% conditions. The agents in the sentences 2, 3, 4 and 5 internally decided to
%% trade, as all the agents need to trade at least some number of units as is
%% required by the implementation. However, the agents learned to trade small
%% amounts of units in these situations, and this is interpreted as a signal to
%% hold the current position and not initiate any new trade.
